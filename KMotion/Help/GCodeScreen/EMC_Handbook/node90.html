Programming Errors and Limitations </A>
</H3>

<P>
The interpreter will issue the following messages involving cutter
radius compensation.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Cannot change axis offsets with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>Cannot change units with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>Cannot turn cutter radius comp on out of XY-plane
</LI>
<LI>Cannot turn cutter radius comp on when already on
</LI>
<LI>Cannot use G28 or G30 with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>Cannot use G53 with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>Cannot use XZ plane with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>Cannot use YZ plane with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>Concave corner with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>Cutter gouging with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>D word on line with no cutter comp on (G41 or G42) command
</LI>
<LI>Tool radius index too big
</LI>
<LI>Tool radius not less than arc radius with cutter radius comp
</LI>
<LI>Two G codes used from same modal group.
</LI>
</OL>
For some of these messages additional explanation is given below.

<P>
Changing a tool while cutter radius compensation is on is not treated
as an error, although it is unlikely this would be done intentionally.
The radius used when cutter radius compensation was first turned on
will continue to be used until compensation is turned off, even though
a new tool is actually being used.

<P>
<TABLE  WIDTH="0%">
<TR><TD>
When cutter radius compensation is on, it must be physically
possible for a circle whose radius is the half the diameter given
in the tool table to be tangent to the contour at all points of the
contour.

In particular, the interpreter treats concave corners and concave
arcs into which the circle will not fit as errors, since the circle
cannot be kept tangent to the contour in these situations. This error
detection does not limit the shapes which can be cut, but it does
require that the programmer specify the actual shape to be cut (or
path to be followed), not an approximation. In this respect, the interpreter
differs from interpreters used with many other controllers, which
often allow these errors silently and either gouge the part or round
the corner. If cutter radius compensation has already been turned
on, it cannot be turned on again. It must be turned off first; then
it can be turned on again. It is not necessary to move the cutter
between turning compensation off and back on, but the move after turning
it back on will be treated as a first move, as described below.

<P>
It is not possible to change from one cutter radius index to another
while compensation is on because of the combined effect of rules 4
and 11. It is also not possible to switch compensation from one side
to another while compensation is on. If the tool is already covering
up the next XY destination point when cutter radius compensation is
turned on, the gouging message is given when the line of NC code which
gives the point is reached. In this situation, the tool is already
cutting into material it should not cut.

<P>
If a D word is programmed that is larger than the number of tool carrousel
slots, an error message is given. In the current implementation, the
number of slots is 68.

<P>
The error message. &#34;two G Codes Used from Same Modal Group,&#34;
is a generic message used for many sets of G codes. As applied to
cutter radius compensation, it means that more than one of G40, G41,
and G42 appears on a line of NC code. This is not allowed.
