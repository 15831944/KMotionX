B.3.4 Introduction To Terminal Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>
When a terminal starts it will show you some sort of prompt that says
it is ready to accept a command. This prompt will most likely show
you who you are and where you are. On this PC that prompt looks like
[root@surfer ray]# This prompt says that I am root and I am at
a PC named surfer and I am in the directory named ray. If you are
curious who you really are you can issue the command 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>whoami&lt;enter&gt;
</DD>
</DL>which gets me the answer ``root.'' Issuing the command

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>pwd&lt;enter&gt;
</DD>
</DL>is equivalent to asking the question where am I? This command gets
me the answer /home/ray.

<P>
This is in essence how the entire text mode of Linux works works.
At a prompt, you enter a command and press the &lt;enter&gt; key. 

<P>
The command may have arguments that go along with it. Let me illustrate
with the Linux equivalent of the ms-dos dir command. That command
is ls (lower case LS). The response that I get to this command is
a window full of file names. They may arranged in multiple columns,
but that depends upon the size of the terminal window and the length
of the file names. A brief list follows.

</DD>
</DL>The ls command will take arguments so if I issue the command ls -l
I will get a different listing that the first one.

</DD>
</DL>There are several ways that you can use to find out about the arguments
that a command will take. In a terminal window you can issue the command
info or man followed by the command that you want to study. Most graphical
environments have help systems that are easier to use than these terminal
commands. If I issue the 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>info&nbsp;ls
</DD>
</DL>command with the ls argument as above, Linux runs a program called
info that returns what it can find about the command ls. Among all
of the info stylized report, I can find out that 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>`ls': List directory contents
</LI>
<LI>The `ls' program lists information about files (of any type, including
directories). 
</LI>
<LI>Options and file arguments can be intermixed arbitrarily, as usual.
</LI>
<LI>by default `ls' lists the contents of directories, not recursively, 
</LI>
<LI>omitts files with names beginning with `.'. 
</LI>
<LI>By default, the output is sorted alphabetically.
</LI>
</UL>
The fact that you entered a single word, info, and the terminal executed
a program named info is the significant point here. There are thousands
of commands. Any file marked with executable permissions is an acceptable
command to the terminal. If this file resides in a directory that
is not included in the normal Linux path, you will have to preceed
the filename with a ./ so that Linux assumes that you want to look
for this command in the current directory.

<P>
There are many different ``command shells'' available to users
of Linux. Right now I can almost hear you gasp - ``I don't really
want to know this.'' Most all of the shells will execute a command
like ls and will start a binary file for you. Which shell you are
running becomes important if the file that you want to run is a script.
Under dos we commonly wrote script files and gave them a .bat extension.

<P>
These script files become important for EMC users because the .run
files that start the EMC are script files. Fortunately, writers of
good script files, include a line at the top of their script file
that specifies the shell that the file is written to run with. Any
terminal will see such a line and switch itself to the shell specified.
