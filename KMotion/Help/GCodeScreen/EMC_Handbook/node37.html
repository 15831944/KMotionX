I also found while working with the servo tuning (last summer)...
FF1 (I think that is the non-zero FFn parameter in my .ini file) is
VERY effective in improving following error, and is, in fact, BETTER
than a PID could do, because, of course, it knows IN advance what
is GOING to happen at a velocity change!&nbsp; I was able to get following
error down to under .001&#34; under practically all circumstances
by setting FF1 to a small value, somewhere between 4 and 7.5 or so.
You can see my graph at http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~jmelson/servo.html
showing a jog move at 90 IPM. Oh, yes, one other thing, the acceleration
parameters in the default EMC .ini file are ridiculous. I had been
ignoring jerky motion when manually jogging when I started working
with EMC, until I broke a brand new toothed belt on my Y axis. This
led me to realize the system was demanding much too much acceleration,
and I slowed it down quite a bit. No belts have broken since then.

&gt; Yes, it's fast, it's definitely an industrial-strength milling center.
It's 
<BR>&gt; not a humming sound it's more like a grinding or laboring sound.
It runs in 
<BR>&gt; my mind that it ran more &#34;freely&#34; before, but
it might just be a result of 
<BR>&gt; the compensation - maybe I didn't notice when it was slamming back
and forth. 

<P>
Well, I still think it is what I saw, but maybe not. Does the sound
change at different jog speeds? What is your P parameter in the axis
setup, in fact what are all your parameters in there? If the P gain
is set too high, it could cause rough operation. Yes, it could be
tuning of the servo amp, too. I found it was best to run with a conservative
P, I and D set to zero, and a small value on FF1, about 5.0 This gave
me really minute following error and quite solid position holding,
without any instability. 

<P>
&gt;&nbsp; I think the next step is going to be working with the logging program,
to 
<BR>&gt; determine the fine tuning of the amps.&nbsp; Then, I think I saw in a
post from 
<BR>&gt; Fred, that there is supposed to be a program that helps come up
with the PID 
<BR>&gt; values. 

<P>
Unless they've done some serious repair in the PID department, the
I and D are programmed wrong, and do not do anything useful. Unfortunately,
the controls theory used in EMC gave a steady-state, or at least one
quadrant, definition of PID algorithms. The problem is this is a motion
control problem in all FOUR quadrants. And, Integral history from
when you were in a different quadrant is not only irrelevant, but
makes your solution MORE inaccurate, instead of reducing error. But,
pedantically, because you are SUPPOSED to use the entire history of
the system, EMC holds that you MUST use the entire history, even if
it fails to perform the necessary goal. 

<P>
The Derivative term probably works, in the general sense, but since
this is a quantized system, and in slow motion there are so few encoder<A NAME="1827"></A>
counts per servo cycle, the Derivative term from each encoder cycle
has WAY too much quantization noise to perform well. It needs to be
smoothed a bit. Fortunately, they put in the FF0, FF1 and FF2 terms,
which are both mathematically pure, and of great use. FF1 is actually
better than some combination of I and D, because it can respond BEFORE
error develops, as in a rapid acceleration of the system from rest.
The I term won't know what is going on for minutes, because it is
taking the average of millions of tiny errors past, and due to the
quantization, you can't set the D term very high, or the system gets
unstable. As long as the servo amps are well behaved, just using P
and FF1 has worked VERY well for me. 

<P>
So, I don't know what the auto-tune program will do with those parameters.
If good, it will also find them to be unhelpful, and leave them close
to zero.
