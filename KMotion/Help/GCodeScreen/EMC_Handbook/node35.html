8.1 Ray's Experience </A>
</H1>

<P>
All three variables (6+ really) look at what is happening between
commanded and actual position in the emc. My comments below may be
a bit unsatisfying for those who are accustomed to very precise things
but they come from a number of years of twiddling with servo controls. 

<P>
P - process variable. 

<P>
----------- 

<P>
This is the gain control. It is a bit like the volume on a music system.
If it is set too low you can't follow the lyrics. If it's set too
high the windows rattle and the neighbors fuss. 

<P>
Some authors refer to P as proportional band. Think of it as a pair
of lines, one ahead of the commanded position and one behind it. Actual
position should be somewhere between the lines. If the actual position
is farther behind then that below line the controller will run the
axis flat out to reach the slower line. Conversely, if the actual
position is ahead of the above line the controller will do all it
can to bring actual position down to that upper bound. 

<P>
As long as the actual position is between the lines, the controller
will ramp gain up and down so that actual approaches commanded. 

<P>
The larger the P number the narrower the space between these lines.
Set P too low and your axis works like a dedicated couch potato during
super bowl or world soccer finals - even a fire may not rouse it.
This condition is rather easy to spot because the axis is sluggish. 

<P>
Set P too high and your axis will develop palsy. On most machines
you can hear this condition by putting your ear to the motor. You
may want to do this when others aren't watching - or use a stethoscope
or a long socket extension - or perhaps the graph function. 

<P>
Palsy will sound like a hum or grind when the motor is sitting still
or moving very slowly. You can also feel palsy if you wrap your hand
around the ball screw or grip the drive belt or pulley. (disclaimer
- This demonstration is done by a professional with only three remaining
fingers, don't try this at home) 

<P>
Deadband may mask too much P when a motor is sitting still so you
may want to move the axis very slowly and listen to the sounds around
each step. If the axis keeps up with commanded position at high speed
and during acceleration and there is not a lot of ringing, grinding,
jumping at very low speed, then you are real close.

<P>
&nbsp;

<P>
I - Integral variable. 

<P>
----------- 

<P>
Integral works a bit like a shock absorber. Any change in either actual
or commanded position gets rounded off or averaged in so that acceleration/deceleration
brought about by P is absorbed and released more slowly over time. 

<P>
No integral and you get the full P effect of change in commanded position.
Too much integral and the axis seems to wander off on it's own without
much regard for P. A little integral may smooth out some of the frequency
jumps when a stepper is running right near one of those troublesome
rates.

<P>
&nbsp;

<P>
D - Derivative variable 

<P>
------------ 

<P>
Derivative works like passing gear for acceleration or a jake-brake
for stopping. Whenever commanded position changes rapidly, d will
really kick the amp/motor in the *** to follow the rate-of-change
of the axis command rather than the difference between commanded and
actual position. 

<P>
Derivative works against inertia so if you've got lots of iron to
start or stop dial some in. But derivative will increase palsy so
you have to balance it against gain.

<P>
&nbsp;

<P>
FF1-3 Feed Forward variables 

<P>
--- 

<P>
I know very little about the effect of these variables.&nbsp; My first
experience with them is while using EMC.&nbsp; I need to include an idea
from Jon Elson and his work with servos and his Bridgeport.&nbsp; He has
used a value up to 8.0 for FF1 with a somewhat reduced acceleration
to very successfully minimize following error.&nbsp; The relevant portions
of his ini file are:

<P>
Your results will no doubt vary.

<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">T - Test </FONT></TT>
<P>


<P>
---- 

<P>
The final proof of tuning is in the cutting. So after your best guess
with all the watching, hearing, feeling done to each axis, get out
a chunk of soft aluminum, a small end or ball mill, and begin to mill
circles or arcs that pass 90 degrees between each pair of axis. I
like outside circles because you can hold them up to the light and
see how the finish looks near the quadrants. 

<P>
Digital systems will give you some steps as one axis approaches zero
and the other approaches the set feedrate so don't expect a perfect
mirror arc finish. Backlash and backlash compensation also affect
the appearance here. Servo drives will work better than steppers.
(digital vs analog) But the smoother the saw teeth the better. 

<P>
Be prepared to spend some metal on this! And make a list of your settings,
changes, and a better/worse judgment about the result of each change.
On occasion I've spent pages of paper and made piles of swarf to get
a stubborn machine to where I wanted it. 

<P>
&nbsp;

<P>
Good luck and may the electromotive force be with you.
