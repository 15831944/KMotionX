<span style="font-family: Arial">KMotion/KFlop</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
uses a simple method of preemptive multitasking (multiple programs or &quot;Threads&quot; 
running at the same time).&nbsp; Each Thread consists of an area of memory where 
a program can be loaded, A CPU Stack for that program, and a potential time 
slice of the CPU.&nbsp; User Programs (Threads) and 
the System Thread context switch every Servo Interrupt and sequence in a round 
robin order.</span></p>

<font face="Arial">The main thing to understand is that two programs that ever 
need to be running at the same time need to be assigned to different threads. 
The KFLOP system Thread runs all the time in Thread #0. So Thread #0 may never 
be used. In a typical KMotionCNC system the Init.c program is usually assigned 
to thread #1 and runs forever. If other UserButtons (or MCodes) run C Programs 
that do something and terminate (Exec/Wait option) then these might all be 
assigned to use Thread#2. If your programs run for a longer time where a 3rd or 
4th program might be Launched so they all overlap in time, then they must all be 
assigned to different Threads.<br>
<br>
All Threads are killed (stop executing) when the Big Red Stop Button is pushed - 
except for thread #7. So use thread #7 for anything you wish to continue to run 
after a Stop.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-family:Arial">The C function WaitNextTimeSlice() can be used 
to wait until the next context switch occurs and return immediately at the 
beginning of the next time slice.&nbsp; This can assure that the User Program can 
execute for a few microseconds without being interrupted and at a very stable 
rate (with a few microseconds of jitter).</span></p>
